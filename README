README for nfg.sidnepp, a simple python wrapper 
for the SIDN EPP interface.

http://www.nfg.nl

It supports an EPP-Proxy for reducing the number of sessions
hitting the upstream SIDN EPP service.

It also includes a wrapper for the XML-Whois service operated
by SIDN, which is the preferred way to access domain information.

For usage examples please check tests.py and whois.py.
